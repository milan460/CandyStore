# Candy Store Application
The Candy Store application enables users to add a monetary balance to their account, allowing them to make purchases from our inventory of candy. Users can select multiple candies to add to their cart and buy using their account balance. The application calculates and returns the correct change, also providing a receipt to the user. It accurately logs all user activities, including adding funds to their balance, specifying the quantity of a particular candy added to the cart, and the accurate change provided to the user.
